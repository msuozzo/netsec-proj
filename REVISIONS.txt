======Revisions========

## -1: Missing instructions on responding to openssl prompts.  

While we did update README.txt to mention the prompts, we believe that the
average user would instinctually know to follow the OpenSSL prompts when
running the cert creation script.

## -3: Invalid cert/key messages are not descriptive and do not catch exceptions.



## -2: Passing incorrect server/key in client can get server to exit, this should not be the case

This has been fixed.
