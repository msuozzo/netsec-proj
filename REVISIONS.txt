======Revisions========

## -1: Missing instructions on responding to openssl prompts.  

While we did update README.txt to mention the prompts, we believe that the
average user would instinctually know to follow the OpenSSL prompts when
running the cert creation script.

## -3: Invalid cert/key messages are not descriptive and do not catch exceptions.

We did update some of the most common error cases to provide more specific
error messages but we feel that the overall complexity of TLS makes the task of
accurate error handling to be necessarily error-prone. The risks of providing
an inaccurate message, in many cases, outweigh the benefits of attempting to
enumerate and handle the error conditions.

## -2: Passing incorrect server/key in client can get server to exit, this should not be the case

This has been fixed.
